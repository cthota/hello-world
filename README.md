This is what I am talking about. Life  goes round and round in a circle and one goes on doing the same thing again and again. It is a mindless job but we all pretend that we are enjoying everybit of it. It is only at the end we realize what we did was fooling around. We will then start thinking may be we should have been more outright and brave and did what we really liked. By that time we feel we are past our our prime and start thinking what a waste of our lives.
