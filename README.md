# hello-world


This is what I am talking about. Life  goes round and round in a circle, and one goes on doing the same thing again and again. It is a mindless job and we all pretend that we are enjoying everybit of it. It is only later that we realize, what we did was fooling around. Then, we will start thinking may be, we should have been more outright and brave, and did what we really liked. By that time it dawn upon, we start feeling that we are past our prime and we start thinking that we have wasted precious time of our life.
